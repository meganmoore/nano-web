  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Six weeks</li>
           
           <li>Q. What sort of research were you doing?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I was helping to process some data from the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) low latitude survey of the southern sky.</li>
          
           <li>Q. Did being abroad influence the kind of research you're doing?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Yes, I had the opportunity to visit and use the Effelsberg telescope, and researching at a German institute gave me more of a world perspective on pulsar astronomy</li>
           
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing about being abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Learning about and exploring a new place and a new culture</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's your favorite new phrase from the language? </li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I don't know if I have a favorite... the phrase I used most, though, was "Sprechen Sie Englisch?", meaning "Do you speak English?". Most Germans know English at at least a basic level, and will usually want to practice their English with you as soon as they can tell that German is not your first language.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Figuring out  which restaurants to eat at - it's hard to tell which ones have the best balance between great food and reasonable prices.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Explored! I visited a few places on the weekends, including a WWII bunker, zoo, a chocolate museum, a mathematics museum, and a castle. During the evenings I explored the town I was living in, Bonn, and enjoyed the Rhine River, which was only a 20 minute walk from my apartment.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Watched Germany win the world cup in a small town bar with a bunch of astrophysicists and a bunch of Germans. There was so much energy in the town during and after the game.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Recycling is a huge thing in Germany, and supermarkets will give people money for bringing back their bottles. I saw lots of people digging through trash to find bottles to return to supermarkets for money.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Explore as much as you can and immerse yourself in the culture.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Lots of pulsar searching skills, as well as how to find my way around without understanding much of the language, and interacting with people in German.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I would've taken a different approach to public transportation. There are tons of ticket options and routes for every trip and it's difficult to find the cheapest option.</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Seoul University is tucked right in the mountains.  This made it easy to go on short day hikes. Along with this, the Seoul Zoo, the largest zoo I have ever seen, was only a short subway ride away.  Most of the down time was spent just exploring our unique surroundings.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> While in Korea, I had a cousin who was also there for business. It was cool to meet up with someone you knew from half-way around the world.   </li>        
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Eating live octopus is up there.
</li>        
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Try to make the most of it. Go out and explore the city or town that you are in. Don’t let your room suck you in. Get out of your comfort zone and try to order and buy things yourself. </li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I learn a great deal about array systems and the software that is need to run them.    
</li>        
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  I wish I knew more of the language. It would have made things easier but not as exciting.</li>

          <li>Q. What university were you attending/doing research at?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> It was a research institute rather than a university.  I was at the CSIRO/ATNF facility in Epping, near Sydney. </li>        
          <li>Q. How long were you there?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Four and a half months
 </li>        
          <li>Q. What sort of research were you doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I was helping to develop methods by which point-like sources of gravitational waves can be studied by pulsar timing arrays.  I focused primarily on gravitational wave bursts with memory</li>        
          <li>Q. Did being abroad influence the kind of research you're doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Absolutely.  I learned several things that influenced what I was doing at the time and I gained many ideas for current and future projects.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Day in day out, I would say it was getting to experience all of the birds in Sydney.  They're unlike anything we have in the US.  They're really quite amazing.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's your favorite new phrase from the language? </li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Well, the language is English, but the man I worked with most directly, George Hobbs, was British, and commonly described questionable things as "dodgy".  I've adopted this phrase.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Sydney is a really expensive place to live.</li>        
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I read books, exercised, and travelled around the Sydney area</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  Probably Manly, a beach community in North Sydney.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> A red bellied black snake just hanging out in the gutter on the side of the street right near where I was staying.
</li>        
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Go for a long enough time that you'll be able to build relationships with the people you work with.</li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I'm a better collaborator than I was before.  I'm a better multi-tasker.</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I would have worked harder because the Australians are very capable and generous collaborators.</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> A round trip ticket in the United Kingdom is a return ticket - this threw me off the first time and I ended up purchasing two one way tickets instead.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Being away from home - I had traveled alone before but never this long.</li>        
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The weirdest thing I did might have more been a strange realization - when people realized that my friend and I had traveled from Manchester to London for the day (a 2 hour train ride) they were shocked that we had done this. In UK a 2 hour trip is usually at least a weekend trip away. Their sense of distance really threw me off, because for me a 2 hour trip (one way) in a day is nothing.</li>        
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Try to get out as much as possible - looking back on the experience I always wished I had done more.</li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I have learned to be independent and adapt to other cultural expectations - can be hard but usually is a lot of fun.</li>        
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I would get out and travel even more - I let my insecurities stop me sometimes and looking back that’s when I should have said yes.</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I worked on compiling a list of known pulsars re-detected by the PALFA survey in preparation for the upcoming proposal. Additionally, I timed a few newly discovered PALFA pulsars.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The coolest thing was definitely the culture. Even though I was in Canada (and expected most things to be similar to the US), I experienced quite a culture shock. This is not only true because Montreal is a large city, but  because it is a mesh of English and French/European culture.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The hardest thing was not being able to speak French. While most people you meet are bilingual, they do prefer to speak in their native language. Ordering food from a French menu is not too straightforward either.</li>        
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  The coolest thing I saw were the student protests. There were literally thousands of people protesting in various parts of city, advocating for no tuition hikes. You could hear pots and pans banging everywhere!</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The weirdest thing I saw were naked protesters in the middle of crowds.</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Dealing with cable/electric/gas companies and landlords is quite complicated while you're abroad, especially without phone access. Make sure everything is dealt with before heading out of the country. Aside from that, keep an open mind and enjoy your experience abroad!</li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I learned quite a few French phrases, which was really useful. I also learned how to use BiXi ("public" bikes which you can rent all through the city). They're very convenient/addicting and I wish we had them here in my home institution.</li>        
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Not really. I think I was able to balance getting a lot accomplished and experiencing Montreal.</li>

         <ul class="list-unstyled"> 
          <li> Q.  What country were you staying in?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I studied abroad in England.</li>        
          <li>Q. What university were you attending/doing research at?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> While in England, I attended the University of Manchester.</li>        
          <li>Q. How long were you there?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I stayed at Manchester for a semester (from September 2012 to December 2012)</li>        
          <li>Q. What sort of research were you doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> My research involved investigating high-energy transient radio bursts originating from outside of our galaxy. I created an algorithm that searches large amounts of pulsar observation data for the presence of these short- lasting transient bursts.</li>        
          <li>Q. Did being abroad influence the kind of research you're doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  Being abroad allowed me to diverge from the pulsar-related work I had been conducting as undergraduate. I instead was able to investigate an aspect of gravitational wave detection, namely the events that could create such gravitation waves.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Probably the coolest thing about being abroad was experiencing a new culture, teaching style and research environment all in the same semester</li>        
           <li>Q. What's your favorite new phrase from the language? </li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> When I arrived in Manchester, a few weeks had passed before I was finally able to regularly use the British phrase “cheers” instead of “thank you.” The other phrase I adapted to using was “Alright there?” This phrase, which is roughly equivalent to “Hey, how are you?”, caused me a bit of head- scratching during my first week.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The most difficult aspect of studying abroad is adapting to a different culture all by yourself. It was rather frightening to me until I began socializing on a regular basis.</li>        
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Other than working on my research, I often roamed around Manchester looking for parks and interesting buildings like museums. Manchester has a number of educating and entertaining museums.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  Although enjoying the night life and live music was really fun, the coolest thing I’ve done during my study abroad trip was working with some of the most respected scientists in the world on a project that was very new and unique. Every day had the potential of an exciting discovery!</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Often when I told people that I am from West Virginia University, they would respond by singing the first few verses of John Denver’s “Country Roads” song. I was rather surprised that so many people were so familiar with our state’s song!</li>        
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> To a fellow student who has decided to go abroad for a semester or a year, I would suggest that they talk to as many people as they can when they arrive at their new home. Doing so helps to both reduce the anxiety of being on your own and allows you to become more culturally aware. Don’t be afraid to try new things!</li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The most important skill I learned while abroad was how to more effectively communicate my ideas, not only in an academic environment, but also in everyday interactions.</li>        
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I would have liked to pursue this research abroad experience during my junior year rather than my senior year. The semester start and end dates in European countries are often different than those in the United States. Thus, as a senior, I was only able to stay for a semester.</li>

          <li>Q. What sort of research were you doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  I studied scintillation patterns for PTA pulsars by constructing signal to noise histograms using short integration times.

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> In general -- the public transportation system was amazing.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's your favorite new phrase from the language? </li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Cheers!</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Living out of a suitcase for months gets tiring quickly. I found it a lot easier once I started making friends and feeling more at home in Australia.</li>        
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Went to coffee shops, explored the downtown area, met some penguins, went surfing, went to comedy clubs, tried new restaurants, watched LOTS of footy, played volleyball and hung out with friends.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  Going surfing all day at a beach right at the start of the Great Ocean Road was probably the best time I had all trip. It was sunny with moderately-sized waves, which made for a very nice first experience. After 6 hours of surfing, we went to a nearby fish and chips restaurant and ordered the 'Deluxe Family Size' meal; fried fish has never tasted so good! I also quite enjoyed having the night shift for several days' observing at Parkes; watching the sun rise, the morning fog lifting and kangaroos stampeding around the grounds is an image I will never forget.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The plane I took from Sydney to Parkes was probably the smallest plane I've ever flown in. On the day of departure, the flight was delayed due to WIND -- apparently some of the strongest they'd ever had. When we got bussed out to the plane, it had been strapped to the tarmac, but was still bucking with every gust, so much that its front wheel would lift several feet off the ground. Boarding has never been such a thrilling activity.</li>        
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Planning a place to stay for several months is difficult. First of all, apartments typically turn over on a month to month basis, so it's hard to plan anything in advance and second, landlords don't usually like to rent for such a short timecol-sm-, unless there are special circumstances. Get in touch with people who live where you're going (grad students, etc.) and ask for advice on where to live and/or if they know anyone going abroad who might need a sublease. Making arrangements with strangers by phone/email can work, but a certain amount of trust must be established in order for them to actually hold an apartment (I had a landlord back out on very short notice and had to find another apartment in less than a week). Also look into university housing options and talk to administrators for more advice</li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  Socket programming, networking with PPTA folks, python scripting, observing experience at Parkes.</li>        
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I wish I had started surfing earlier! My first time was pretty late in the trip, so I didn't have time to go back out.</li>

          <li> Q.  What country were you staying in?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Australia, in Sandy Bay (a suburb of Hobart, the capital city of Tasmania)</li>        
          <li>Q. What university were you attending/doing research at?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> University of Tasmania</li>        
          <li>Q. How long were you there?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  I was abroad for five months.</li>        
          <li>Q. What sort of research were you doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  I took a normal course load with two physics classes, including a third year electromagnetism class and an experimental astrophysics class. I went with the intention of doing research, but there was a problem with the telescope.</li>        
          <li>Q. Did being abroad influence the kind of research you're doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Experimental astrophysics was not offered at Oberlin. Because I studied at the University of Tasmania, I was able to gain experience using two telescopes, one radio and one optical, for different projects.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> The Tasmanians call it ‘bushwhacking,’ but Americans would call it hiking. I did a ton of it. Every weekend, I would be on a bushwhacking trip. I got to see almost the entire state.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's your favorite new phrase from the language? </li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  “I can’t be bothered/stuffed.” It means “screw that.” I often used it to describe my feelings for tedious assignments.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  It was really expensive, and it was really hard to be away from friends and home. Culturally, it wasn’t too different from the US. The lectures and exams we took were a different format from home, so that was also hard to get used to.</li>        
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I took an Aboriginal studies class, which was super interesting. I also studied, did physics, and took observations.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  There was an amazing market in Hobart. They sold everything like food, produce, clothes, souvenirs. I really felt like it was a much healthier place. Even the air seemed cleaner at the market, and it felt pure.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I don’t understand people’s obsession with Vegemite. They put it on everything and eat it by the spoonful. It’s disgusting.</li>        
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> No matter where you go, be very proactive about putting yourself out there and doing things. It’s easy to do the normal things. It’s a lot harder to make an effort to get out of your comfort zone. Do something that scares you everyday.</li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I learned early on to approach strangers with higher authority like professors. It was hard in a place where I don’t know people very well and needed to ask for help. I’m pretty independent, but being in Tasmania meant I got a lot better at paying bills and managing a household. I lived in house with six people. Two were from France, one was from Denmark, one was from India, one was from Malaysia, and another from the US. None of them spoke English well, so my communication skills are super now.</li>        
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>  I feel like I did what I wanted to do. I wish that I would have spent less time worrying about work. I had a lot of work, and I came abroad wanting to travel and explore. The workload with the cultural experience was a lot at once. I would get upset if I was in the library all day because I felt like it was something I could do at home. In the end, after everything, I’m really proud of what I did accomplish there. I did four pretty major, substantial projects. I feel like I did a really good job as well as taking advantage of being in another country in another hemisphere on the opposite side of the world.</li>

     I spent 6 weeks at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. I was working on Millisecond Pulsar data tables and plotting relationships to analyze the quality of the data. My work will also be used as templates for future users to simplify the tables.
</p>
<p>
Being abroad definitely had a big impact on me. Before I was a little unsure about which academic path I wanted to take, but now I'm positive that I want to go into scientific research. My favorite part about being abroad was meeting so many different people from different countries. I chose to go to Amsterdam because I didn't really know as much about Northern Europe and I learned so much just by talking to the people I worked with and just in the city. It was great being in Amsterdam because even though the national language is Dutch, everyone spoke almost perfect English. So I got to experience a new language while still being able to talk to everyone. I don't have a particular favorite phrase in Dutch but I really like how when I first would see something written it would look so strange to my American eyes, just a jumble of crazy random letters, but then when I heard it spoken it sounded very similar to the English word!
</p>
<p>
The hardest part I experienced being abroad was I had trouble making friends. I was only there for 6 weeks and I was put in the department with the PhD students and postdocs, so everyone was significantly older than me and permanent residents. That being said, everyone was so nice and friendly. It just would have been nice to have someone to explore the touristy parts of the city with. In my free time I usually explored Amsterdam on my bike. It's a beautiful city with great bike paths leading anywhere you want to go. I think the coolest part about being abroad was being able to travel to other countries on the weekend. I traveled to England, Paris, and Italy while I was there and it was so strange to think that I could just fly off to another country for a weekend! I experienced a lot of weird things while I was abroad but one of my favorite ones was watching the native Hollanders ride their bikes. They would carry all kinds of ridiculous things on their bikes with no problems - multiple children, mattresses, animals, a weeks worth of groceries, or even ride two bikes at once! 
</p>
<p>
My advice to other people going abroad is to just try to do and see as many things as possible. Also, I did a tour of Amsterdam on my first day there, which was great because it gave me a feel for the city and the guides have lots of great ideas for things to do. Also, just talk to everyone, people in stores, on the train, anywhere. People are nice and generally like to help you. I wish I would have met more people who were my age. But in general I had an amazing time and I don't regret anything!

<p>I researched abroad in Sydney, Australia. There I spent half my time taking classes at the University of Sydney and half my time working at the Australian Telescope National Facility. I conducted independent research related to pulsar timing with some of the top experts in the field. I spent the first few weeks getting to know some background information as well as learning the most commonly used software. I ended up focusing on dispersion measure variations and the interstellar medium, and by the end of my time there had given a talk at a national pulsar conference and written a full paper on the work I had done.
</p>
<p>
Beyond having this fantastic research opportunity I also got to explore Australia and meet many interesting and fun people along the way. I traveled to northern Australia where I was able to take tours of the rainforest and snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef. I traveled to the outback to see Uluru, the world’s largest rock. I spent a day whale watching and riding camels. I went skydiving out of a plane at 14,000 ft!
</p>
<p>
Studying abroad was a huge transition, and while it may have been a bumpy ride at first, in the end I came out happier, more confident, and more experienced in the professional and international world. It was definitely a positive life changing experience for me. Not only do I now have some incredible references and mentors to help me along the way to whatever path I choose, but also some incredible friends spread across the world. I’ve also gained an amazing amount of professional experience that I can tell will help me in the job world no matter what I end up doing. Perhaps most importantly though, I have gained social skills that helped me make new friends in new places that I know will always make my life easier and happier in the future. I found this program extremely useful and would definitely recommend it to others.
