  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

           <li>Q. How long were you there?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Six weeks</li>
           
           <li>Q. What sort of research were you doing?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I was helping to process some data from the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) low latitude survey of the southern sky.</li>
          
           <li>Q. Did being abroad influence the kind of research you're doing?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Yes, I had the opportunity to visit and use the Effelsberg telescope, and researching at a German institute gave me more of a world perspective on pulsar astronomy</li>
           
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing about being abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Learning about and exploring a new place and a new culture</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's your favorite new phrase from the language? </li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I don't know if I have a favorite... the phrase I used most, though, was "Sprechen Sie Englisch?", meaning "Do you speak English?". Most Germans know English at at least a basic level, and will usually want to practice their English with you as soon as they can tell that German is not your first language.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's the hardest thing about being abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Figuring out  which restaurants to eat at - it's hard to tell which ones have the best balance between great food and reasonable prices.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Explored! I visited a few places on the weekends, including a WWII bunker, zoo, a chocolate museum, a mathematics museum, and a castle. During the evenings I explored the town I was living in, Bonn, and enjoyed the Rhine River, which was only a 20 minute walk from my apartment.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Watched Germany win the world cup in a small town bar with a bunch of astrophysicists and a bunch of Germans. There was so much energy in the town during and after the game.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Recycling is a huge thing in Germany, and supermarkets will give people money for bringing back their bottles. I saw lots of people digging through trash to find bottles to return to supermarkets for money.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What advice would you offer others going abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Explore as much as you can and immerse yourself in the culture.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Lots of pulsar searching skills, as well as how to find my way around without understanding much of the language, and interacting with people in German.</li>
        
           
           <li>Q. Is there anything you'd do differently or anything you wish you'd have known?</li>
           <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I would've taken a different approach to public transportation. There are tons of ticket options and routes for every trip and it's difficult to find the cheapest option.</li>

          <li>Q. Did being abroad influence the kind of research you're doing?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Well, the KVN is unique and had its own interesting challenges, but scientific interest in pulsar astronomy appears to be universal.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing about being abroad?</li>

           <li>Q. What did you do in your free time?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span>i Seoul University is tucked right in the mountains.  This made it easy to go on short day hikes. Along with this, the Seoul Zoo, the largest zoo I have ever seen, was only a short subway ride away.  Most of the down time was spent just exploring our unique surroundings.</li>        
           <li>Q. What's the coolest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> While in Korea, I had a cousin who was also there for business. It was cool to meet up with someone you knew from half-way around the world.   </li>        
           <li>Q. What's the weirdest thing you've seen or done while abroad?</li>

          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> Try to make the most of it. Go out and explore the city or town that you are in. Don‚Äôt let your room suck you in. Get out of your comfort zone and try to order and buy things yourself. </li>        
           <li>Q. What skills have you learned abroad?</li>
          <li><span class="col-sm-offset-1 glyphicon glyphicon-comment"</span> I learn a great deal about array systems and the software that is need to run them.
