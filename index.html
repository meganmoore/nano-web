		    We seek to measure gravitational waves--ripples in
		    space-time--by detecting their effect on radio
		    wave signals traveling from pulsars--rapidly
		    rotating neutron stars--to the Earth.  Our
		    measurements are most sensitive to gravitational
		    waves with periods of a few years, which
		    corresponds to frequencies of a few
		    nanohertz--hence the "NANO" in our name,
		    "NANOGrav."  The strongest sources of such
		    gravitational waves are likely to be binary
		    systems in which two massive black holes orbit one
		    another.  Such binary systems form when galaxies
		    merge with one another.

		    Pulsars are rapidly rotating stars. A pulsar emits
		    beams of radio waves which, like lighthouse beams,
		    sweep through the sky as the pulsar rotates. The
		    signal from a pulsar can be detected by radio
		    telescopes as a series of regularly spaced pulses,
		    essentially like the ticks of a clock. In fact,
		    for the purposes of this experiment, it's useful
		    to think of the pulsars as clocks. Gravitational
		    waves affect the time it takes the pulses to
		    travel from the pulsar to a telescope on Earth.
		    We seek out perturbations due to gravitational
		    waves in measurements of pulse arrival times at a
		    telescope, in other words, we look for deviations
		    in the clock ticks! In particular, we search for a
		    distinct pattern of correlation and
		    anti-correlation between the signals over an array
		    of different pulsars (a "pulsar timing array").
		    Although pulsar pulses travel through space for
		    hundreds or thousands of years to reach us, we are
		    sensitive to perturbations in their travel time of
		    much less than a millionth of a second.  We seek
		    out ways to improve our sensitivity to
		    gravitational waves, including discovering more
		    pulsars, improving instrumentation at telescopes,
		    studying the characteristics of pulsars and the
		    interstellar medium which affect our measurements,
		    and developing new algorithms for detection
		    gravitational waves.

		    We collect pulsar data using two extremely

		    the Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
		    the largest telescope in the world, to observe
		    pulsars with declinations between 0 and 38
		    degrees.  We use the Green Bank Telescope in Green
		    Bank, West Virginia, the largest fully-steerable
		    single-dish telescope in the world, to observe
		    pulsars not visible from Arecibo at declinations
		    higher than -45 degrees.  We are part of the
		    International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) which is
		    a collaboration of NANOGrav with similar European
		    and Australian counterparts.  The IPTA overall
		    uses 9 of the world's largest radio telescopes to
		    accomplish gravitational wave detection.  We
		    collaborate with astrophysicists elsewhere to take
		    advantage of other telescope resources worldwide.

		    Throughout human history, all the information we
		    have received from outside our own solar system
		    has come in the form of electromagnetic waves
		    (light, radio, X-rays, etc.).  Gravitational wave
		    astronomy will give us an entirely new spectrum
		    with which to observe the universe.  The
		    gravitational wave regime probed by pulsar timing
		    (nanohertz) is complementary to those probed by
		    ground detectors such as LIGO (kilohertz) and by
		    proposed space missions (millihertz).  The
		    separation in frequency between these instruments
		    is the comparable to the separation between radio,
		    optical, and gamma rays in the electromagnetic
		    spectrum.  Each technique for detecting
		    gravitational waves promises exciting, unique
		    science.

		    We envision ourselves as an ongoing (a decade or

		    decadal timescale.  Our present program is already
		    providing unique constraints on gravitational
		    waves from in-spirals of supermassive black holes,
		    cosmic strings, and other sources.  Our pulsar
		    timing array presently consists of 35 pulsars, and

		    new, high quality millisecond pulsars.  We
		    anticipate that growth in the population of

		    telescope sensitivity through recently
		    commissioned instrumentation, and lengthening of
		    data sets on all pulsar sources will bring our

		Gravitational waves (GWs) are ripples in space-time
		that are known to exist but have not yet been detected
		directly. Once they are, a key feature of any viable
		theory of gravity will be demonstrated and a new
		window on the universe opened. GW astronomy was named
		as one of five key discovery areas in the “New
		Worlds and New Horizons” Decadal Report. Pulsar
		timing probes GW frequencies, and hence source
		classes, that are inaccessible to any other detection
		method and can uniquely constrain the nonlinear nature
		of General Relativity. Pulsar timing is therefore a
		critical capability with its own discovery space and
		potential. <b>Fulfilling this capability requires the
		complementary enabling features of both the Green Bank
		Telescope (GBT) and the Arecibo Observatory.</b>
