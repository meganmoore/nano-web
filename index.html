Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz--hence the "NANO" in our name, "NANOGrav."  The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another.  Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.

                            <div id="how" class="accordion-body collapse"><div class="accordion-inner">Pulsars are rapidly rotating stars. A pulsar emits beams of radio waves which, like lighthouse beams, sweep through the sky as the pulsar rotates. The signal from a pulsar can be detected by radio telescopes as a series of regularly spaced pulses, essentially like the ticks of a clock. In fact, for the purposes of this experiment, it's useful to think of the pulsars as clocks. Gravitational waves affect the time it takes the pulses to travel from the pulsar to a telescope on Earth.  We seek out perturbations due to gravitational waves in measurements of pulse arrival times at a telescope, in other words, we look for deviations in the clock ticks! In particular, we search for a distinct pattern of correlation and anti-correlation between the signals over an array of different pulsars (a "pulsar timing array").  Although pulsar pulses travel through space for hundreds or thousands of years to reach us, we are sensitive to perturbations in their travel time of much less than a millionth of a second.  We seek out ways to improve our sensitivity to gravitational waves, including discovering more pulsars, improving instrumentation at telescopes, studying the characteristics of pulsars and the interstellar medium which affect our measurements, and developing new algorithms for detection gravitational waves.

We use the Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the largest telescope in the world, to observe pulsars with declinations between 0 and 38 degrees.  We use the Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia, the largest fully-steerable single-dish telescope in the world, to observe pulsars not visible from Arecibo at declinations higher than -45 degrees.  
        We are part of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) which is a collaboration of NANOGrav with similar European and Australian counterparts.  The IPTA overall uses 9 of the world's largest radio telescopes to accomplish gravitational wave detection.
         We collaborate with astrophysicists elsewhere to take advantage of other telescope resources worldwide.

Gravitational wave astronomy will give us an entirely new spectrum with which to observe the universe.  The gravitational wave regime probed by pulsar timing (nanohertz) is complementary to those probed by ground detectors such as LIGO (kilohertz) and by proposed space missions (millihertz).  The separation in frequency between these instruments is the comparable to the separation between radio, optical, and gamma rays in the electromagnetic spectrum.  Each technique for detecting gravitational waves promises exciting, unique science.

Our present program is already providing unique constraints on gravitational waves from in-spirals of supermassive black holes, cosmic strings, and other sources.   Our pulsar timing array presently consists of 35 pulsars, and it grows by several pulsars a year as we discovery new, high quality millisecond pulsars.  We anticipate that growth in the population of pulsars under observation, improvements in telescope sensitivity through recently commissioned instrumentation, and lengthening of data sets on all pulsar sources will bring our detection levels into the range of predicted amplitudes for the stochastic background of gravitational waves within a few years.
