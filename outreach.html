<h3>What is gravity?</h3>
<hr>
<p>When most people think of gravity, they think of a <b>force</b> that
keeps keeps things together: it keeps people on the surface of the
Earth, it keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun, and it even keeps/
the stars in entire galaxies together.  This way of thinking about
gravity &mdash; as a long range force of attraction &mdash; was firmly
established in the 17th century by Isaac Newton.  Newton's law of
gravity is a spectacular example of how some simple mathematical rules
can accurately explain what we observe in nature.  But it isn't the
end of the story.  By the end of the 19th century, people had found
several situations in which the classical physical laws didn't quite
work, including Newton's law of gravity.  The theory wasn't totally
wrong, but it was incomplete.  Few people realized just how profoundly
a more complete law of gravity would change our view of the Universe,
but that is exactly what happened after Albert Einstein weighed in.</p>

<p>In 1916, Einstein published his <b>general theory of relativity</b>, a
completely new way of thinking about gravity.  In general relativity,
or GR, we think of gravity as a distortion, or curvature, of the
fabric of space and time itself (called <b>space-time</b>).  In this
context, space means the distance between two objects, or the shortest
path you could take to get between point A and point B.  This is not
the same thing as "outer space" &mdash; every thing in the Universe
exists in space-time, including the Earth and everything on (and in)
it.  The time of space-time refers to that which is measured by
clocks.</p>

<p>What does this all mean?  You can think of space-time as a sheet of
fabric that is pulled tight (it isn't a perfect analogy, but it is the
simplest one).  Now imagine placing a heavy object like a bowling ball
on this sheet.  The sheet curves into a well around the bowling ball,
and according to GR, this curvature <b>is</b> gravity.  A smaller
object like a golf ball placed on the sheet will naturally fall
towards the larger object, and if you give the golf ball a little
push, it will circle the bowling ball just like a planet orbiting a
star (friction eventually causes the golf ball to hit the bowling
ball, but in space this doesn't happen).  Anything and everything with
mass (from stars to actual golf balls) will cause this curvature of
space-time, and hence create a <b>gravitational field</b>.  This may
all sound pretty wild, but GR is the most elegant and complete
description of gravity ever, and it has been passed every test that
scientists have ever put it to.  In other words, it works, and it
works well.</p>
<br>
<h3>What are gravitational waves?</h3>
<hr>

<p>One of the predictions of GR that has <b>not</b> been directly
observed is the existence of <b>gravitational waves</b>.
Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time that are
caused when massive objects move in a certain way.  These ripples
actually cause objects to shrink and stretch as the wave passes
through them, but the effect is <b><i>tiny</i></b> &mdash; even a very
strong gravitational wave will cause an object to shrink and stretch
by one part in a <b>quadrillion</b> (1 quadrillion =
1,000,000,000,000,000)!  Although we have indirect evidence for the
existence of gravitational waves, we have never directly observed
them.</p>

<h3>Why do we care about gravitational waves?</h3>
<hr>
<p>But why are we so interested in detecting gravitational waves to begin
with?  Well, for the whole of human history, almost everything we have
learned about the distant Universe (everything outside our Solar
System) has come from studying things that emit <b>light</b>.  Some
very important contributions have also been made by studying things
that emit sub-atomic particles, but for the most part light is our
main window into the Universe.  Of course, not everything emits light,
or at least light that we can easily detect.  Some examples are
<b>black holes</b>, <b>white dwarfs</b> (a type of dead star), and
<b>neutron stars</b> (more on them below), as well as hypothetical
objects called <b>cosmic strings</b>.  It is also impossible for us to
detect light from when the Universe was younger than about 379,000
years old.  But all of these things (specifically pairs of black
holes, white dwarfs, and neutron stars orbiting eachother) are
predicted to emit gravitational waves.  <b>A direct detection of
gravitational waves will open an entirely new window on our Universe
and allow us to learn things that we couldn't learn about
otherwise.</b> The things we will be able to study using gravitational
waves are some of the most fascinating and extreme things in the
entire Universe.  And in the past, whenever we have opened up new
frontiers in astronomy, we have discovered things we never even
imagined.  So we will almost certainly be surprised by what we learn
from gravitational waves.  And this is where NANOGrav comes in.</p>

<h3>What is NANOGrav?</h3>
<hr>
<p>NANOGrav is a <b>collaboration</b> of astronomers, physicists, and
engineers from across the United States and Canada, whose common goal
is to directly detect gravitational waves using objects known as
<b>pulsars</b>.  Pulsars are a type of neutron star, the remains of a
dead star that was more massive than our Sun, but not massive enough
to form a black hole.  Pulsars are extreme, fascinating, and just
plain cool objects in and of themselves &mdash; a teaspoon of neutron
star material on Earth would weigh as much as the entire human race!
And pulsars have magnetic fields so strong that they would erase every
credit card and computer hard drive on Earth...even if the pulsar was
as far away as the Moon!  But from the point of view of NANOGrav, what
makes a pulsar so interesting is that it can be used as a <i>very</i>
precise clock.  That is because pulsars send out a beam of <b>radio
waves</b>, and because they spin rapidly.  Each time the beam of a
pulsar points towards the Earth, we see a pulse of radio waves (hence
the name pulsar).  So pulsars are a lot like cosmic light houses.  The
fastest-spinning pulsars spin once every few milliseconds (that is
hundreds of time in a single second), and so are called millisecond
pulsars, or <b>MSPs</b>.  The key idea here is that the pulse of a
pulsar acts just like the tick of a clock, and MSPs approach atomic
clock in their precision.  A change in the rate at which the pulsar
"ticks" tells us something about the environment that the pulsar is
in, or about something that happened to the pulse as it traveled to
Earth.</p>

<p>NANOGrav uses pulsars like a sort of cosmic global positioning system
(GPS).  The GPS that you use in your car or on your phone works by
communicating with satellites in orbit around the Earth, and can
determine your position very accurately.  NANOGrav is using MSPs to do
the same basic thing: to look for tiny changes in the position of the
Earth that are due to the shrinking and stretching effect of passing
gravitational waves.  Just like GPS uses several satellites spread
throughout the sky, NANOGrav uses an <b>array</b> of MSPs.  This is
known as a <b>pulsar timing array</b>.  And since gravitational waves
have such a small effect, only a handful of the most stable MSPs that
make the best clocks will work.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>NANOGrav astronomers use the world's most sensitive radio telescopes
to observe these MSPs: the <b>Arecibo Telescope</b> located in
Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and the <b>Green Bank Telescope</b> located in
Green Bank, West Virginia.  Arecibo is 305 meters in diameter, the
size of 3 football fields, making it extremely sensitive.  But because
it is so big, it can't be moved around, and so can only look at the
sky directly overhead, and a little bit off to the sides.  The Green
Bank Telescope is 105 meters in diameter (as big as one football
field, so still huge), and can look anywhere in the sky.  Without both
of these exquisite and one-of-a-kind telescopes, detecting
gravitational waves would be a lot harder.</p>

<p>NANOGrav hasn't detected gravitational waves yet but we believe that
we will be successful within the next <b>five to ten years</b>.  To
meet this goal we need a few things: 1) access to the world-class
Arecibo and Green Bank Telescopes, 2) as many clock-like MSPs as we
can get our hands on, 3) a good understanding of our MSPs so that we
can be confident that they really do make great clocks, and 4) time.
This last need is important because our pulsar timing array becomes
more sensitive to gravitational waves as we observe the pulsars over
many years.</p>

<p>NANOGrav isn't the only experiment trying to detect gravitational
waves using a pulsar timing array.  There are similar projects using
telescopes in Europe (the <b>European Pulsar Timing Array</b>) and
Australia (the <b>Parkes Pulsar Timing Array</b>).  It will probably
be necessary for these different projects to cooperate and share their
data in order to be successful, and so in 20?? they came together to
form the <b>International Pulsar Timing Array</b>.  There are also
other experiments using totally different, non-pulsar based methods to
detect gravitational waves.  Two examples are LIGO, and its European
counterpart VIRGO.  But NANOGrav and the IPTA are hoping to be the
<b>first</b> to detect gravitational waves.  And <b>you can help</b>
us find more MSPs through the Einstein@Home project.  This is your
chance to be a part of a ground breaking discovery!</p>

<h3>Get Involved</h3>
<hr>
<p>One of the ways to get involved in the search for gravitational waves is to participate in the distributed computing project <a href="http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu">Einstein@Home</a>. Einstein@Home uses your computer's idle time to search for weak astrophysical signals from spinning neutron stars (also called pulsars) using data from the LIGO gravitational-wave detectors, the Arecibo radio telescope, and the Fermi gamma-ray satellite. It's possible that a pulsar found in the project could be used in a pulsar timing array to detect gravitational waves!</p>
 
<p>If you are a teacher looking for information about gravitational waves, <a href="http://gwastro.org/for%20educators">this site</a> hosted by Penn State University's gravitational wave research group has a great collection of articles and projects.</p>

<p>Members of NANOGrav support three major outreach projects: the <a href="http://arcc.phys.utb.edu/ARCC_v2/Welcome.html">Arecibo Remote Command Center</a>, the <a href="http://pulsarsearchcollaboratory.org">Pulsar Search Collaboratory</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fandm.edu/andrea-lommen/marie">Mid-Atlantic Relativistic Initiative in Education</a>. These projects are helping to get middle and high school students involved in the real work of using and analyzing data from two of the world's best radio telescopes.</p>
